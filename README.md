# UCL Simulator

A program to "simulate" the 2022/23 UEFA Champions League based on data from the group stages. Its actual purpose is to practice OOP as well as modulra design in Python, not to predict results successfully.

The formula used to predict the results used data from the Group Stages of the Champions League, and it successfully predicted the Campion (Manchester City), as well as many of the games. It predicted the Round of 16 with an 87.5% accuracy.

The main script was later modified to run a complete simulation "n" times, store the winners and give you the percentages of how many times a team won.
